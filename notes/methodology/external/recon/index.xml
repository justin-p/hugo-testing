You want to identify a target code repo and search all commit history to discover secrets that might have been pushed.

This is publicly correlated in a searchable log. Using Certificate Transparency logs you may be able to find additional subdomains or other top level domains.
You could also search on a disclosed internal hostname from things such as e-mail headers and find the publicly accessible URL associated with this machine or other machines that share the internal domain (hostname01.domain.local, hostname02.domain.local) by looking at the x509v3 extension data.</description></item><item><title>Credential Gathering</title><link>https://notes.justin-p.me/notes/methodology/external/recon/credential-gathering/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Mar 2020 16:43:44 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://notes.justin-p.me/notes/methodology/external/recon/credential-gathering/</guid><description>Credential Gathering When you want to infiltrate an organization gaining some form of credentials will be key. One of the ways to gain these credentials is to search database and other form of leaks. A user might reuse his password on multiple accounts or use a specific pattern in their passwords.

Apart from getting to know where their assets are most of the times these days there is a proxy infront of web applications that require the correct vhost (DNS hostname) to access them.
DNS Bruteforce Seclists has great wordlists for DNS bruteforce.
Try to find commonalities between domains and iterating names. Think about web01.domain.tld and web02.domain.tld, try web03,04,05 etc.</description></item><item><title>E-Mail Gathering</title><link>https://notes.justin-p.me/notes/methodology/external/recon/user-enumeration/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Mar 2020 16:43:44 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://notes.justin-p.me/notes/methodology/external/recon/user-enumeration/</guid><description>User enumeration When you want to infiltrate an organization gaining some form of credentials will be key. One of the ways to gain these credentials would be to preform brute-force techniques, such as password spraying. But in order to preform these you would first need to have a list of potential usernames. This is where user enumeration comes in.
Username schema If the target organisation is Microsoft based you will most likely be able to use 2 usernames for each account.</description></item><item><title>Google Dorking</title><link>https://notes.justin-p.me/notes/methodology/external/recon/google-dorking/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Mar 2020 16:43:44 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://notes.justin-p.me/notes/methodology/external/recon/google-dorking/</guid><description>Google Dorking Google dorks are search filters you can use in google.

This can range to what CMS a website is using, where a site is hosted, to what potential targets are &amp;lsquo;hidden&amp;rsquo; behind a ADFS server.

Web search engines, such as Google and Bing, are great for finding websites. But what if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in measuring which countries are becoming more connected? Or if you want to know which version of Microsoft IIS is the most popular? Or you want to find the control servers for malware? Maybe a new vulnerability came out and you want to see how many hosts it could affect?</description></item></channel></rss>
