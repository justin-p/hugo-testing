TCP provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of octets (bytes) between applications running on hosts communicating via an IP network. Major internet applications such as the HTTP, SMTP, SSH, and SFTP rely on TCP. SSL/TLS often runs on top of TCP.
TCP is connection-oriented. A connection between client and server is established before data can be sent, this connection establisment is called the Three-way handshake.</description></item><item><title>Layer 5</title><link>https://notes.justin-p.me/notes/networking/osi-model/layer5/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Mar 2020 16:43:49 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://notes.justin-p.me/notes/networking/osi-model/layer5/</guid><description>Layer 5 Num 5 Name Session Acronim Sausage PDU What is &amp;lsquo;on it&amp;rsquo; Session management (sockets) Function Managing communication sessions, i.e. continuous exchange of information in the form of multiple back-and-forth transmissions between two nodes This layer is responsible for establishment of connection, maintenance of sessions, authentication and also ensures security.</description></item><item><title>Layer 6</title><link>https://notes.justin-p.me/notes/networking/osi-model/layer6/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Mar 2020 16:43:49 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://notes.justin-p.me/notes/networking/osi-model/layer6/</guid><description>Layer 6 Num 6 Name Presentation Acronim Pizza PDU Data What is &amp;lsquo;on it&amp;rsquo; AVI, GIF ,JPEG, MKV Function Translation of data between a networking service and an application; including character encoding, data Presentation layer is also called the Translation layer. The data from the application layer is extracted here and manipulated as per the required format to transmit over the network.</description></item><item><title>Layer 1</title><link>https://notes.justin-p.me/notes/networking/osi-model/layer1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Mar 2020 16:43:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://notes.justin-p.me/notes/networking/osi-model/layer1/</guid><description>Layer 1 Num 1 Name Physical Layer Acronim Please PDU Bit What is &amp;lsquo;on it&amp;rsquo; Data cables (CAT5e, CAT6), Terminations (RJ45,SFP), Hub, Repeater, Modem Function Transmission and reception of raw bit streams over a physical medium The lowest layer of the OSI reference model is the physical layer. It is responsible for the actual physical connection between the devices.</description></item><item><title>Layer 2</title><link>https://notes.justin-p.me/notes/networking/osi-model/layer2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Mar 2020 16:43:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://notes.justin-p.me/notes/networking/osi-model/layer2/</guid><description>Layer 2 Num 2 Name Data link Acronim Do PDU Frame What is &amp;lsquo;on it&amp;rsquo; NIC, Switch, Bridge Function Reliable transmission of data frames between two nodes connected by a physical layer The data link layer is responsible for the node to node delivery of the message. The main function of this layer is to make sure data transfer is error free from one node to another, over the physical layer.</description></item><item><title>Layer 7</title><link>https://notes.justin-p.me/notes/networking/osi-model/layer7/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Mar 2020 16:43:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://notes.justin-p.me/notes/networking/osi-model/layer7/</guid><description>Layer7 Num 7 Name Application Acronim Away PDU What is &amp;lsquo;on it&amp;rsquo; HTTP, SMTP, SMB Function High-level APIs, including resource sharing, remote file access At the very top of the OSI Reference Model stack of layers, we find Application layer which is implemented by the network applications. These applications produce the data, which has to be transferred over the network.</description></item><item><title>Layer 3</title><link>https://notes.justin-p.me/notes/networking/osi-model/layer3/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Mar 2020 16:33:40 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://notes.justin-p.me/notes/networking/osi-model/layer3/</guid><description>Layer 3 Num 3 Name Network Acronim Not PDU Packet What is &amp;lsquo;on it&amp;rsquo; Router Function Structuring and managing a multi-node network, including addressing, routing and traffic control Network layer works for the transmission of data from one host to the other located in different networks.
