## chisel

### Installation

```bash
https://github.com/jpillora/chisel/releases
```

#### Docker

```bash
docker run --rm -it jpillora/chisel --help
```

#### go get

```bash
go get -v github.com/jpillora/chisel
```

### Usage

#### Server

```bash
chisel server [options]
```

#### Client

```bash
chisel client [options] <server> <remote> [remote] [remote] ..
```

### Flags

#### Server

```bash
    --host, Defines the HTTP listening host – the network interface
    (defaults the environment variable HOST and falls back to 0.0.0.0).

    --port, -p, Defines the HTTP listening port (defaults to the environment
    variable PORT and fallsback to port 8080).

    --key, An optional string to seed the generation of a ECDSA public
    and private key pair. All communications will be secured using this
    key pair. Share the subsequent fingerprint with clients to enable detection
    of man-in-the-middle attacks (defaults to the CHISEL_KEY environment
    variable, otherwise a new key is generate each run).

    --authfile, An optional path to a users.json file. This file should
    be an object with users defined like:
      {
        "<user:pass>": ["<addr-regex>","<addr-regex>"]
      }
    when <user> connects, their <pass> will be verified and then
    each of the remote addresses will be compared against the list
    of address regular expressions for a match. Addresses will
    always come in the form "<remote-host>:<remote-port>" for normal remotes
    and "R:<local-interface>:<local-port>" for reverse port forwarding
    remotes. This file will be automatically reloaded on change.

    --auth, An optional string representing a single user with full
    access, in the form of <user:pass>. It is equivalent to creating an
    authfile with {"<user:pass>": [""]}. If unset, it will use the
    environment variable AUTH.

    --keepalive, An optional keepalive interval. Since the underlying
    transport is HTTP, in many instances we'll be traversing through
    proxies, often these proxies will close idle connections. You must
    specify a time with a unit, for example '5s' or '2m'. Defaults
    to '25s' (set to 0s to disable).

    --backend, Specifies another HTTP server to proxy requests to when
    chisel receives a normal HTTP request. Useful for hiding chisel in
    plain sight.

    --socks5, Allow clients to access the internal SOCKS5 proxy. See
    chisel client --help for more information.

    --reverse, Allow clients to specify reverse port forwarding remotes
    in addition to normal remotes.

    --tls-key, Enables TLS and provides optional path to a PEM-encoded
    TLS private key. When this flag is set, you must also set --tls-cert,
    and you cannot set --tls-domain.

    --tls-cert, Enables TLS and provides optional path to a PEM-encoded
    TLS certificate. When this flag is set, you must also set --tls-key,
    and you cannot set --tls-domain.

    --tls-domain, Enables TLS and automatically acquires a TLS key and
    certificate using LetsEncypt. Setting --tls-domain requires port 443.
    You may specify multiple --tls-domain flags to serve multiple domains.
    The resulting files are cached in the "$HOME/.cache/chisel" directory.
    You can modify this path by setting the CHISEL_LE_CACHE variable,
    or disable caching by setting this variable to "-". You can optionally
    provide a certificate notification email by setting CHISEL_LE_EMAIL.

    --tls-ca, a path to a PEM encoded CA certificate bundle or a directory
    holding multiple PEM encode CA certificate bundle files, which is used to 
    validate client connections. The provided CA certificates will be used 
    instead of the system roots. This is commonly used to implement mutual-TLS. 

    --pid Generate pid file in current working directory

    -v, Enable verbose logging

    --help, This help text
```

#### Client

```bash
    --fingerprint, A *strongly recommended* fingerprint string
    to perform host-key validation against the server's public key.
        Fingerprint mismatches will close the connection.
        Fingerprints are generated by hashing the ECDSA public key using
        SHA256 and encoding the result in base64.
        Fingerprints must be 44 characters containing a trailing equals (=).

    --auth, An optional username and password (client authentication)
    in the form: "<user>:<pass>". These credentials are compared to
    the credentials inside the server's --authfile. defaults to the
    AUTH environment variable.

    --keepalive, An optional keepalive interval. Since the underlying
    transport is HTTP, in many instances we'll be traversing through
    proxies, often these proxies will close idle connections. You must
    specify a time with a unit, for example '5s' or '2m'. Defaults
    to '25s' (set to 0s to disable).

    --max-retry-count, Maximum number of times to retry before exiting.
    Defaults to unlimited.

    --max-retry-interval, Maximum wait time before retrying after a
    disconnection. Defaults to 5 minutes.

    --proxy, An optional HTTP CONNECT or SOCKS5 proxy which will be
    used to reach the chisel server. Authentication can be specified
    inside the URL.
    For example, http://admin:password@my-server.com:8081
            or: socks://admin:password@my-server.com:1080

    --header, Set a custom header in the form "HeaderName: HeaderContent".
    Can be used multiple times. (e.g --header "Foo: Bar" --header "Hello: World")

    --hostname, Optionally set the 'Host' header (defaults to the host
    found in the server url).

    --tls-ca, An optional root certificate bundle used to verify the
    chisel server. Only valid when connecting to the server with
    "https" or "wss". By default, the operating system CAs will be used.

    --tls-skip-verify, Skip server TLS certificate verification of
    chain and host name (if TLS is used for transport connections to
    server). If set, client accepts any TLS certificate presented by
    the server and any host name in that certificate. This only affects
    transport https (wss) connection. Chisel server's public key
    may be still verified (see --fingerprint) after inner connection
    is established.

    --tls-key, a path to a PEM encoded private key used for client 
    authentication (mutual-TLS).

    --tls-cert, a path to a PEM encoded certificate matching the provided 
    private key. The certificate must have client authentication 
    enabled (mutual-TLS).

    --pid Generate pid file in current working directory

    -v, Enable verbose logging

    --help, This help text
```

### Examples

#### Basic Reverse

Listen on port 8000

```bash
./chisel server --reverse
```

Forward local port 8080 to the server on port 8001

```bash
./chisel client <server_ip:server_port> R:8001:127.0.0.1:8080
```

On the chisel server you can now access the service hosted on port 8080 on port 8000 over the tunnel.

#### Reverse Socks

![Reverse Socks](images/reverse_sock.png)

Start a server on the server node

```bash
chisel server -p 8000 -reverse
```

Connect the client to the server node and expose a unused local port that will be used for the socks5 proxy.

```bash
chisel client <server_ip:server_port> R:8001:127.0.0.1:9000
```

Start a server instance on the client that suports socks5

```bash
chisel.exe server -p 9000 --socks5
```

Start a client on the server node.

```bash
chisel client 127.0.0.1:8001 socks
```

Use proxychains to connect to a endpoint through chisel

```bash
proxychains crackmapexec smb 192.168.56.10
```
